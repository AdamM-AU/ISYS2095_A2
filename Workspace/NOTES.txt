1NF Rules:
- Column Names must be unique
- Stored data in required order
- No Mixed Data types in columns
- No Multivalued attributes in columns (A,B) should only be A
- CAN NOT use a Composite Key (Key + Key OR PKEY + Key)

2NF Rules:
- Be in 1NF Form
- Have No Partial Dependencies
- Have a composite key

3NF Rules:
- Be in 2NF Form
- Have No Transitive Dependency


Definitions:
Dependency = Functional Dependency (We can use PKey/Primary Key to fetch any attribute from the table
Partial = Data non reliant on PKey -> Should be in another table or its own table
OR/AND
Where an attribute in the table depends on only part of the PKey(Composite PKEY) and not the PKey (Composite PKey) as a whole

Transitive = When a non-primary attribute depends on another or other non-prime attributes rather than depending upon the primary attributes or PKEY
